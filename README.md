The first file I write to create an image that I can use to build a container, 
using Dockerfile, during my learning of the Docker Master course.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Dockerfile1 : 
I started with the Ubuntu container system,  
specified the container creator,  
gave it commands to install and update apt-get,  
and finally, printed the message on the screen.

Dockerfile2 :
created a directory with a file containing some data.

Docrefile3 :
Create a Docker File Volume using a Docker file
